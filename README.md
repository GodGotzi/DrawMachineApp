# PatternEngine

### A project by Gottsbacher Elias & Trau√ünigg Jan

## The Project Idea

Our project was to build a Spirograph machine that draws geometric patterns on rotating paper using two joints and a pen holder. The joints are controlled by stepper motors, which move the pen at different angles. The pen holder is equipped with a spring-like 3D printing mechanism that regulates the pressure on the paper. The paper is rotated by another stepper motor, which is slowed down by a gearbox. The paper plate rotates exactly once per drawing, while the joints rotate much faster.

We used various techniques and tools for this project, such as 3D printing, aluminum profiles, plexiglass, stepper motors and drivers, a self-designed circuit board, and a display. We also programmed a simulation that shows us what the finished drawing will look like based on the speeds of the joints and the paper plate.

The key steps of our project were:

- Creating a concept sketch and selecting suitable motors and materials.
- Controlling the stepper motors with stepper drivers and overcoming initial challenges.
- Building the machine's rough structure using aluminum profiles (using the Item Engineering tool).
- Mechanical design in Inventor.
- Developing an electrical schematic in KiCad.
- Creating a PCB layout in KiCad and ordering and assembling the PCB.
- Assembling the real machine with a display, power supply, socket, 3D printed joints, and pen holder.
- Calculating the motion equations for the joints and the paper plate.
- Programming a simulation using G-Code.
- Wiring the components and commissioning the machine.

Our project was a great success from which we learned a lot. We not only built a functional Spirograph machine but also gained experience with various technologies.

It represents a directory in a workspace. It has a constructor to initialize the path of the directory. It also overrides the `delete()` and `rename()` methods from the parent class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It controls file functionalities like deletion and renaming while extending a tree node. The class provides a constructor and a method to check if the element is a file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

It extends the WorkspaceElement class and stores a reference to the actual file. It provides methods to retrieve the file, check if it is a file, and implements abstract methods for deleting and renaming the file.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

It provides methods to reset the tree, reload the tree model, and retrieve the root node. The reset method removes all the children of the root node, sets its user object to "..." and reloads the tree. The reload method reloads the tree model.                                                                                                                                                                   |

It allows users to load a workspace from a file and detects changes in the workspace. Users can open files by double-clicking on them in the workspace view. The code is designed to be flexible and customizable through various handlers.                                                                                                                                                             |
